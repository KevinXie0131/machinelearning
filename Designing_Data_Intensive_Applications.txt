Scalability
Fault tolerance/high availability
Latency

Shared-Nothing Architectures (horizontal scaling / scaling out)
node / multiple geographic regions

Replication - redundancy
reduce latency / increase availability / increase read throughput
single-leader / multi-leader / leaderless replication
synchronous / asynchronous / semi-synchronous replication - durability / consensus

eventual consistency
read-your-writes / mono‐tonic reads guarantees

replica - leader-based replication - active/passive / master–slave replication
leader (master / primary)
followers (read replicas / slaves / secondaries / hot standbys) - replication log or change stream

Setting Up New Followers / downtime / snapshot / caught up
go down / high availability
Follower failure: Catch-up recovery

Leader failure: Failover
1. Determining that the leader has failed / timeout
2. Choosing a new leader
3. Reconfiguring the system to use the new leader

Partitioning - sharding
