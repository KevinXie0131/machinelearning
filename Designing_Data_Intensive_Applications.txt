Scalability
Fault tolerance/high availability
Latency

Shared-Nothing Architectures (horizontal scaling / scaling out)
node / multiple geographic regions

Replication - redundancy
reduce latency / increase availability / increase read throughput
single-leader / multi-leader / leaderless replication
synchronous or asynchronous replication

eventual consistency
read-your-writes / mono‐tonic reads guarantees

replica - leader-based replication - active/passive / master–slave replication
leader (master / primary)
followers (read replicas / slaves / secondaries / hot standbys) - replication log or change stream


Partitioning - sharding
