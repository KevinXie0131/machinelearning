Remote procedure calls (RPCs): an interprocess communication protocol / RPC spans the transport and application layers
The responsibilities of RPC runtime also include retransmission, acknowledgment, and encryption
The RPC method is similar to calling a local procedure, except that the called procedure is usually executed in a different process and on a different computer.

Consistency Models:
    Eventual consistency (Weakest consistency) -> Causal consistency -> Sequential consistency -> Strict consistency / linearizability (Strongest consistency)

1. Eventual consistency ensures high availability
2. Causal consistency works by categorizing operations into dependent operations (causally-related operations) and independent operations / cause-and-effect relationship
3. Sequential consistency preserves the ordering specified by each client's program.
4. Strict consistency is the strongest consistency model. synchronous replication is one of the ingredients for achieving strong consistency, though it in itself is not sufficient. We might need consensus algorithms such as Paxos and Raft to achieve strong consistency.
   Linearizability affects the system's availability, which is why it's not always used. Applications with strong consistency requirements use techniques like quorum-based replication to increase the system's availability.

ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability
CAP theorem: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance

Failure Models:
Fail-stop (Easy to deal with) -> Crash -> Omission failures -> Temporal failures -> Byzantine failures  (Hard to deal with)

Fault tolerance techniques:
    Replication: One of the most widely-used techniques is replication-based fault tolerance
    Checkpointing: a technique that saves the systemâ€™s state in stable storage when the system state is consistent
                   When a failure occurs in the system, we can get the last computed data from the previous checkpoint and start working from there.

Application servers primarily provide dynamic content, whereas web servers mostly serve static content to the client, which is mostly a web browser.
