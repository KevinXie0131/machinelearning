a new endpoint call to fetch the detailed information

Google Places API: a service that accepts HTTP requests for location data through a variety of methods
read/write ratio / read volume / write volume / infrequent operations

Geospatial indexing is a technique used in databases to efficiently store and retrieve data based on their geographic location
Geohash is a unique identifier of a specific region on the Earth. For a given location on earth, the Geohash algorithm converts its latitude and longitude into a string.

Database cluster can be used for primary-secondary setup
due to replication delay
off-peak hours
different regions and availability zones

geospatial databse such as GeoHash in Redis or PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
Redis geospatial indexes let you store coordinates and search for them. This data structure is useful for finding nearby points within a given radius or bounding box.

Option 1: Two-dimensional search: not efficient
Option 2: Evenly divided grid: the distribution of business is not even / need more granular grids for dense areas and large grids in sparse areas
Option 3: Geohash: reduce two-dimensional longitude and latitude data into one-dimensional string ofa letters and digits / has 12 precisions (also called levels)
                   only interested in geohashes with lengths between 4 and 6 / edge cases with how the geohash boundary is handled
                   the longer a shared prefix is between two geohashes, the closer they are
                   a common solution is to fetch not nly within the current grid but also from its neighbors

Option 4: Quadtree: (a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children)
                   In memory data structure, not database solution. It doesn't take too much memory and easily fit in one server
                   incrementally rebuild the quadtree, a small subset of servers at a time, across the entire cluster
                   roll out a new release / Blue/green deployment
                   mitigated by setting up a business agreement / update the cache using a nightly job
                   update it on the fly

Option 4: Google S2: a library for spherical geometry / in-memory solution / maps a sphere to 1D index based on Hilbert curve

compound key of (geohash, business_id)
have a series of replicas to help with the read load
a key-value store like Redis
no locking mechanism is needed
fetch fully hydrated business information
