线性一致性(Linearizability) --> 顺序一致性(Sequential consistency) --> 因果一致性(Casual consistency) --> 最终一致性(Eventual consistency)

aim for maximal throughput with acceptable latency

Strong consistency (replicated synchronously) --> Eventual consistency (replicated asynchronously) --> Weak consistency

two complementary patterns to support high availability:
    fail-over
        Active-passive / master-slave
        Active-active / master-master
    replication
        Master-slave
        Master-master
